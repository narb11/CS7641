CS 7641 Assignment 1: Supervised Learning Classification
This project seeks to understand the computatitonal and predictive qualities of five classification algorithms (Neural Network, SVM, kNN, Decision Tree, and Boosted Trees).
Each algorithm will be run for two binary classification datasets so that we can compare and contrast them for two different problems.

Dataset 1: Wine Data - available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

Dataset 2: Epilepsy - available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition

Getting Started & Prerequisites
For testing on your own machine, you need to install all libraries mention in the requirements.txt

Code will run with various flags. --['ANN', 'Boosting', 'DT', 'KNN', 'SVM']
